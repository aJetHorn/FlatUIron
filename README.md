# FlatUIron

FlatUIron is a novelty extension for Google Chrome that "flattens" all font and background colors on a webpage to a small palette of colors known as [FlatUI colors](http://flatuicolors.com/). Color schemes using similar palettes are commonly considered to exhibit [Flat Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_design).

### Future Improvements

Future versions will be faster and use expanded color palettes (feel free to add your own). Additionally I'd like to add a revert feature and a significantly-less-resource-intensive stylesheet parser that also targets pseudoclass css.

###FlatUIron and You

Make the web a more beautiful and user-friendly place. Please do whatever you want with this source code (I'd love to see what you make, though).
